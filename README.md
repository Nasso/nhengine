# nhengine
An open 2D Java game engine built mainly with LWJGL3

It's still a Work In Progress, some features are here, but they might change at any time. Also, the documentation isn't *fully* available yet, but is on my TODO list.

## Dependencies
Nhengine has some dependencies. They are all in the `lib/` folder. The given `.project` eclipse project has its classpath setup to use them.
However, you can still download them separately if you want, but it may, or may not work with different versions.

- LWJGL3: You can download it from [their website](https://www.lwjgl.org/download), using `lwjgl-release-custom-zip.json` as the config file.
- GSON: Get it on [the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/gson).
