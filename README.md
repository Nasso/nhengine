# nhengine
An open 2D Java game engine built mainly with LWJGL3

It's still a Work In Progress, some features are here, but they might change at any time. Also, the documentation isn't available yet, but is on my TODO list.

## Dependencies
### Needed
- LWJGL3: You can download it from their website (https://www.lwjgl.org/download), using `lwjgl-release-custom-zip.json` as the config file.
- Processing penner easing functions: https://github.com/jesusgollonet/processing-penner-easing/tree/master/src

### Optional (only for demos)
- emoji-java: https://github.com/vdurmont/emoji-java
	- Which itself needs: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
